# Selvakumar S

**Blockchain Application Developer**  
Web3 • DeFi • Zero-Knowledge • AI Agents

I build decentralized applications, smart contracts, and autonomous on-chain systems.
My work spans **DeFi protocols, ZK proof pipelines, AI-driven agents, and blockchain infrastructure**.

## What I’m Working On

- **0xLocker** – Decentralized encrypted document storage with ownership & permission control  
  *(Solidity, IPFS, Hardhat, Ethereum)*

- **AI Trading Agent** – Autonomous agent that parses messages and executes swaps & staking  
  *(Base L2, Uniswap v4, Compound, Foundry, XMTP)*

- **zkVerify Relayer CLI (Private)** – Automated Groth16 proof generation & submission  
  *(Circom, SnarkJS, Node.js, Horizen Testnet)*

- **Cookie Jar V3** – Shared on-chain fund management with NFT-gated access  
  *(Next.js, Solidity, Ethers.js, wagmi)*
